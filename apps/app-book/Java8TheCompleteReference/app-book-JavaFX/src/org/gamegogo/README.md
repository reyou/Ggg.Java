Introducing JavaFX GUI Programming  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaFX

Like all successful languages, Java continues to evolve and improve. This also applies to its
libraries. One of the most important examples of this evolutionary process is found in its
GUI frameworks. As explained earlier in the book, the original GUI framework was the AWT.
Because of its several limitations, it was soon followed by Swing, which offered a far superior
approach to creating GUIs. Swing was so successful that it has remained the primary Java
GUI framework for over a decade. (And a decade is a long time in the fast-moving world of
programming!) However, Swing was designed when the enterprise application dominated
software development. Today, consumer applications, and especially mobile apps, have risen
in importance, and such applications often demand a GUI that has “visual sparkle.”
Furthermore, no matter the type of application, the trend is toward more exciting visual
effects. To better handle these types of GUIs, a new approach was needed, and this lead to
the creation of JavaFX. JavaFX is Java’s next-generation client platform and GUI framework.
JavaFX provides a powerful, streamlined, flexible framework that simplifies the creation
of modern, visually exciting GUIs. As such, it is a very large system, and, as was the case with
Swing discussed in Part III, it is not possible to describe it fully in this book. Instead, the
purpose of this and the next two chapters is to introduce several of its key features and
techniques. Once you understand the fundamentals, you will find it easy to explore other
aspects of JavaFX on your own.
